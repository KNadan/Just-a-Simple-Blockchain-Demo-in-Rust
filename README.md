# Just-a-Simple-Blockchain-Demo-in-Rust

Description
This project is a fully functional blockchain implemented in Rust, designed for educational and demonstration purposes. It showcases the core principles of blockchain technology, including Proof of Authority (PoA), transaction validation, and immutable record-keeping. Users can interact with the blockchain, manage client balances, and perform transactions in a simulated cryptobank environment.

Features

> User Interaction: Register clients and perform transactions through a user-friendly interface.
> Proof of Authority (PoA): Ensures secure block validation by an authorized node.
> Client Wallets: Each registered client starts with 100 tokens and can send/receive tokens.
> Detailed Blockchain View: Displays block data, including timestamps, hashes, and validators.
> Transaction Logging: Keeps a record of all transactions in a file.
> Blockchain Validation: Confirms the integrity of the blockchain.
