# Just-a-Simple-Blockchain-Demo-in-Rust

Description
This project is a fully functional blockchain implemented in Rust, designed for demonstration purposes. It showcases the core principles of blockchain technology, including Proof of Authority (PoA), transaction validation, and immutable record-keeping. Users can interact with the blockchain, manage client balances, and perform transactions in a simulated cryptobank environment.

Features

User Interaction: Register clients and perform transactions through a user-friendly interface.<br>
Proof of Authority (PoA): Ensures secure block validation by an authorized node.<br>
Client Wallets: Each registered client starts with 100 tokens and can send/receive tokens.<br>
Detailed Blockchain View: Displays block data, including timestamps, hashes, and validators.<br>
Transaction Logging: Keeps a record of all transactions in a file.<br>
Blockchain Validation: Confirms the integrity of the blockchain.<br>

How to use: 
1. Clone the Repository.<br>
2. Run the project with cargo run command in terminal.<br>
3. Interact with the Blockchain.
